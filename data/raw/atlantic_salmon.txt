### Comprehensive Information on Atlantic Salmon (*Salmo salar*)

---

#### 1. **Taxonomy**
- **Family**: Salmonidae  
- **Genus**: *Salmo*  
- **Species**: *Salmo salar*  
The Atlantic salmon is a member of the Salmonidae family, which includes other salmonids like trout, char, and Pacific salmon. It is the only species in the genus *Salmo* native to the Atlantic Ocean.

#### 2. **Detailed Physical Characteristics**
- **Size**: Atlantic salmon typically range from 70 to 150 cm (28 to 59 inches) in length and weigh between 3.6 to 36 kg (8 to 79 lbs), though larger individuals have been recorded.
- **Coloration**:  
  - **Juveniles (parr)**: Dark vertical bars (parr marks) on a silvery background.  
  - **Adults in freshwater**: Olive-green to brown on the back, with silvery sides and a white belly.  
  - **Adults in saltwater**: Silvery with a blue-green back and scattered black spots, primarily above the lateral line.  
- **Body Shape**: Streamlined and torpedo-shaped, adapted for fast swimming.  
- **Fins**: A single dorsal fin, adipose fin (small, fleshy fin near the tail), and a forked caudal fin.  
- **Mouth**: Large, with strong jaws and sharp teeth, especially in males during spawning.

#### 3. **Habitat Preferences and Geographic Distribution**
- **Habitat**:  
  - **Freshwater**: Atlantic salmon spawn in clean, cold, oxygen-rich rivers and streams with gravel bottoms.  
  - **Saltwater**: After smoltification (a physiological adaptation to saltwater), they migrate to the North Atlantic Ocean, where they inhabit coastal and open waters.  
- **Geographic Distribution**:  
  - Native to the North Atlantic Ocean and its tributaries.  
  - Found along the coasts of North America (from Connecticut to northern Canada) and Europe (from Portugal to northern Russia).  
  - Landlocked populations exist in some lakes (e.g., Lake Ontario and Lake Ladoga).

#### 4. **Diet and Feeding Behaviors**
- **Juveniles (Freshwater)**: Feed on aquatic invertebrates, such as insect larvae, crustaceans, and small fish.  
- **Adults (Saltwater)**: Primarily piscivorous, feeding on fish like herring, capelin, and sand eels, as well as crustaceans and squid.  
- **Feeding Behavior**: Opportunistic predators, using speed and stealth to ambush prey. They are diurnal feeders, with peak activity during daylight hours.

#### 5. **Reproduction and Life Cycle**
- **Life Stages**:  
  1. **Egg**: Laid in freshwater gravel nests (redds) by females and fertilized by males.  
  2. **Alevin**: Newly hatched, yolk-sac-dependent larvae.  
  3. **Fry**: Emerge from the gravel and begin feeding externally.  
  4. **Parr**: Develop parr marks and remain in freshwater for 1–3 years.  
  5. **Smolt**: Undergo physiological changes to adapt to saltwater and migrate to the ocean.  
  6. **Adult**: Spend 1–4 years in the ocean before returning to freshwater to spawn.  
- **Spawning**:  
  - Occurs in late autumn to early winter.  
  - Females dig redds in gravel, where they deposit eggs. Males compete for access to females.  
  - Most Atlantic salmon die after spawning (semelparity), though some survive to spawn again (iteroparity).

#### 6. **Conservation Status**
- **IUCN Red List**: Least Concern (globally), but many populations are declining.  
- **Threats**:  
  - Habitat destruction (dams, pollution, deforestation).  
  - Overfishing (historically a major issue).  
  - Climate change (warming waters, altered river flows).  
  - Aquaculture impacts (disease transmission, genetic dilution from escaped farmed salmon).  
- **Conservation Efforts**:  
  - Habitat restoration (e.g., dam removal, riparian buffer zones).  
  - Fishing regulations (catch limits, seasonal closures).  
  - Stock enhancement programs (hatcheries, captive breeding).

#### 7. **Ecological Importance**
- **Keystone Species**: Atlantic salmon play a critical role in nutrient cycling, transporting marine-derived nutrients to freshwater ecosystems during spawning.  
- **Prey and Predator**: Serve as prey for marine mammals, birds, and larger fish, while also regulating populations of smaller fish and invertebrates.  
- **Indicator Species**: Their health reflects the overall condition of freshwater and marine ecosystems.

#### 8. **Human Interactions**
- **Fisheries**:  
  - Historically, Atlantic salmon supported major commercial and recreational fisheries.  
  - Overfishing led to significant population declines, prompting strict regulations.  
- **Aquaculture**:  
  - Atlantic salmon is one of the most farmed fish species globally, particularly in Norway, Scotland, and Canada.  
  - Concerns include environmental impacts (e.g., pollution, escaped farmed salmon interbreeding with wild populations).  
- **Cultural Significance**:  
  - Valued as a food source and symbol in many cultures (e.g., Celtic mythology, Indigenous traditions).

#### 9. **Related Species and Distinguishing Features**
- **Related Species**:  
  - **Pacific Salmon** (*Oncorhynchus* spp.): Includes species like Chinook, coho, and sockeye salmon. Unlike Atlantic salmon, most Pacific salmon die after spawning.  
  - **Brown Trout** (*Salmo trutta*): A close relative, often confused with Atlantic salmon. Brown trout have more pronounced black and red spots and are less migratory.  
- **Distinguishing Features**:  
  - Atlantic salmon have fewer but larger black spots compared to brown trout.  
  - The tail fin of Atlantic salmon is more deeply forked than that of brown trout.  
  - Atlantic salmon are anadromous (migrate between freshwater and saltwater), while some brown trout populations are resident in freshwater.
