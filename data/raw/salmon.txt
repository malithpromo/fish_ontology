Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar)

The Atlantic salmon is an anadromous fish species that spends its adult life in the ocean but returns to freshwater to spawn. It belongs to the family Salmonidae.

Physical Characteristics:
- Average length: 70-75 cm, though can reach up to 150 cm
- Average weight: 3.5-5.5 kg, with some reaching 40 kg
- Silvery body with black spots primarily above the lateral line
- During spawning, males develop a hooked jaw called a kype

Habitat:
Atlantic salmon inhabit the northern Atlantic Ocean and rivers that flow into it. They require clean, well-oxygenated freshwater streams with gravel bottoms for spawning.

Geographic Distribution:
Found in the North Atlantic basin, including rivers in North America (from Connecticut to Quebec), Iceland, Europe (from Portugal to Russia), and the Baltic Sea.

Diet:
- Marine phase: Primarily feeds on crustaceans, squid, and small fish such as herring and sand lance
- Freshwater phase: Aquatic insects, crustaceans, and small fish

Reproduction:
Salmon return to their natal rivers to spawn in late autumn. Females create depressions (redds) in gravel where they deposit eggs, which males then fertilize. Adults may die after spawning or return to the sea. Eggs hatch in spring, and juveniles (parr) remain in freshwater for 1-4 years before smoltification and migration to the sea.

Conservation Status:
Vulnerable (IUCN Red List). Many populations have declined due to overfishing, habitat degradation, pollution, and dam construction.

Ecological Importance:
- Key species in marine and freshwater food webs
- Transport marine-derived nutrients to freshwater ecosystems
- Indicator species for environmental health

Human Interactions:
- Important commercial and recreational fishery
- Aquaculture (farmed salmon accounts for over 70% of salmon production)
- Cultural significance to many indigenous peoples
